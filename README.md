### Dataset Overview
SimUAV is a simulated, not real-world, dataset for UAV small object detection. It contains **29,568** images in **8** scenes or backgrounds including street, trees, grass, mountain lake, palace, winter town, and temple. Each scene has **4** multi-rotor models: Parrot A.R. Drone 2.0, DJI Inspire I, DJI Mavic 2 Pro and Dji Phantom 4 Pro.

### Background

In recent years, UAVs(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, here we mean multi-rotors) have been widely used in agriculture, industry, and the military, bringing great risks to public security such as illegal flying, spy flying, and more seriously， terrorist attack by dropping bombs. Therefore, research on the detection and recognition of UAV targets has already been carried out. Popular technologies for UAV small object detection mainly resort to deep learning algorithms in computer vision, which always need a large number of data. Unfortunately, few object detection datasets are available on multi-rotors. To address (relieve) this issue, we construct the SimUAV dataset which is entirely generated by simulation softwares without any real-world image.

### Task Description
Now, we definite the task of UAV small object detection: determine whether there are any instances of UAV, specifically multi-rotors in an image and, if present, to return the spatial location and extent of each object instance (e.g., via a bounding box). Small here means the ground-truth box size of each object is always small, exactly no larger than 30\*30 pixels in a 640\*640 image. 

### Simulation Platform
We apply Airsim and UE4 as our simulation softwares. Airsim is an open-source simulator for drones, built on Epic Games’ Unreal Engine 4 as a platform for AI research. Airsim allows us to fly multi-rotors in UE4 rendering environments at various velocities and on expected paths which can be set easily by python API. Besides, Airsim supports substituting any 3D model file for the default multi-rotor model. UE4 provides a variety of environments or scenes in Epic Store, including forests, beaches, cities, parks, and so on.
